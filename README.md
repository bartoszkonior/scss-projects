# SCSS Projects

This repository contains multiple projects dedicated to learning and practicing SCSS (Sassy CSS). Each project focuses on different aspects of SCSS, including variables, mixins, nesting, functions, and responsive design.

## Projects Included
- **Natours**: A landing page project demonstrating advanced CSS, SCSS and responsive design.

## Usage
Each project is in its own folder. You can open the `index.html` inside each folder to run the project locally. To work with SCSS, use a Sass compiler (like the Live Sass Compiler extension in VSCode or `node-sass`) to compile SCSS files into CSS.

Example commands to install and run Sass compilation:

```
npm install
npm run scss
```
